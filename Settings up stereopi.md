This is the guide to settings up raspbian

# First of all 
download raspbian <https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest>

If you use non-Lite version of raspberry CM, you must download and install RPIboot <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/computemodule/cm-emmc-flashing.md>

After flashing your Raspberry CM you'll need to download dt-blob.bin. This file configures GPIO Raspberry for two cameras
